Description: an extremely flexible configuration engine
 Morpheus is a configuration engine that supports custom plugins. It allows any program that uses it to be configured and reconfigured
 at different layers like local configuration files, configuration database, environment, etc. The overall program configuration is 
 merged altogether from all these sources.
